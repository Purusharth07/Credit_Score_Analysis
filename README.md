Credit Score Analysis
=============
**A credit scoring model** is a tool that is typically used in the decision-making process of accepting or
rejecting a loan. A credit scoring model is the result of a statistical model which, based on information
about the borrower (e.g. age, number of previous loans, etc.), allows one to distinguish between "good"
and "bad" loans and give an estimate of the probability of default.

**Loan Defalut**: In finance, default is failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.
